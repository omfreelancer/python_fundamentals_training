# ⚡ Stage 11 – Basic Algorithms (Mastery Edition)

This stage is designed to build:
- A Python problem-solving brain  
- Strong logic for freelancing & automation  
- The ability to think like a real developer  
- Confidence before larger projects  

---

## Concepts You Will Master

1. **Linear Search (core real-world skill)**  
   - Check each element in a list until you find a match  
   - Used everywhere in automation, scraping, and data filtering  

2. **Counting Algorithms (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)**  
   - Count vowels, digits, duplicates, etc.  
   - Builds real thinking needed for automation tasks  

3. **Min/Max (without built-ins)**  
   - Manual comparison  
   - Strengthens understanding of loops  

4. **Second Largest Number**  
   - Classic logical challenge  
   - Great for technical interviews  

5. **Reverse List Manually**  
   - No slicing  
   - Trains pointer/index manipulation  

6. **Bubble Sort (training only)**  
   - Swapping + nested loops  
   - Not used in real life, but excellent brain training  

7. **FizzBuzz**  
   - Must-do logic challenge  

**OPTIONAL**

8. **Binary Search**  
   - Only if you want  
   - Academic algorithm, not required for freelancing

## Exercises (Optimized Order)

1. **Linear Search**  
   Write a function that returns:  
   - index of element if found  
   - or `-1` if not found  

2. **Counting Algorithms**  
   Write functions to:  
   - Count how many times a number appears in a list  
   - Count how many vowels are in a string  
   - Count how many uppercase letters are in a string  
   - Count duplicates in a list  

3. **Find Min and Max WITHOUT built-ins**  
   - Do not use `min()` or `max()`  

4. **Second Largest Number**  
   - Find the second largest number in a list  
   - Do it without sorting first  

5. **Reverse List (manual)**  
   - Reverse a list without using slicing (`lst[::-1]` is forbidden)  

6. **Bubble Sort**  
   - Implement bubble sort  
   - Focus on swap logic and nested loops  

7. **FizzBuzz**  
   - Classic logic test  

8. **(OPTIONAL) Binary Search**  
   - Implement binary search on a sorted list

## Mini-Project: 🧠 Student Scores Analyzer

You will:
- Input student names and scores  
- Store them in a list of dictionaries  
- Sort by score  
- Show the top student  
- Show the lowest student  
- Show the average score  
- (Optional) Show how many students scored above average  

This project combines all the core algorithm concepts in this stage.
